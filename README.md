## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Understand feature distributions, correlations, and missing values.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale numerical features.  
- **Model Training:** Train a Linear Regression model on historical housing data.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**.  
- **Prediction Interface:** Input house features via a **Tkinter GUI** and get predicted prices in real-time.
